*About the Z Axis Touch Probe solution* + 
November 2023

More or less 10 years ago, i needed for my new CNC portal a touching probe to set the origin of the Z axis on the top of the material. +
Several approachs exist, starting with the sheet of paper method, but I was looking for something more motivating.

At that time, I played with microcontrollers, hum, and today, I am still playing with microcontrollers for some projects :) +
So the idea was to use these nice small computers to bring a new approach by making the touching probe detection more visible +
and more audible with LED and Buzzer.

The demonstration file proposed here is a conversion of the prototype created 10 years ago. The PIC microcontroller code was developed
initialy +
with MikroE mikroBasic for PIC, and the demonstration folder proposes now my conversion learning to GCBASIC code.

The principle of the solution is to use detection voltage level changes, from 5V to 0V using the PIC falling edge detection,
then generating the adequate interrupt in the code, to quickly send a signal to the CNC interface. The CNC interface is communicating
with the computer executing MACH3 and managing the probe detection by the correct G code instruction.

CNC spindel is electricaly connected to ground, router bit as well, probe plate is connected to +5V by the protected input circuit.
A low voltage level, by touching the plate to the ground through the bit and the spindel, initiates the interrupt and
the signalisation over the CNC interface.

More information about the solution, and how it is working can be read in the proposed source code.
The used microcontroller is a PIC12F683. Some idea for routines, like the pushbutton management are not from me :)

The solution uses a new capability from GCBASIC compiler, look here: +

_Minimum compiler version must be *build 1296* to be able to compile the ZZero source code into Microchip PIC code._

Have a look in the source code !

All these PCBs were created by the CNC portal, no classical etching but bit routing !



*A friend integrated its own active probe circuit inside the CNC interface ....*

*My next project is a CNC2Laser interface, with direct integration of the active probe on the PCB ....* +
(Look on the top right near the ICSP connector.)
