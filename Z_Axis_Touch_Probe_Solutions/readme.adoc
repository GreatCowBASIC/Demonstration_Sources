*About the Z Axis Touch Probe solution* + 
November 2023

More or less 10 years ago, i needed for my new CNC portal a touching probe to set the origin of the Z axis on the top of the material.
Several approachs exist, starting with the sheet of paper method, but I was looking for something more motivating.
At that time, I played with microcontrollers, hum, and I am still playing with microcontrollers today for some projects :)
So the idea was to use these nice small computers to bring an new approach by making the touching probe detection more visible
and more audible with LED and Buzzer.
