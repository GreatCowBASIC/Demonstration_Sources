'''A demonstration program for GCBASIC
'''---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
''' This demonstration simply turns the LED on and off with a wait of 500 ms.
'''
''' This shows how you can DEFINE constants to make your code easier to maintain.

; ----- Configuration
#chip  LGT8F328P
#option Explicit
'GCBASIC simplifies the configuration by setting the frequency and the configuration for you.

    'Set a constant.  The LED can be activated
    #DEFINE LEDOn  = 1
    'Set a constant.  The LED can be de-activated
    #DEFINE LEDOff = 0

    'Set a constant to refer to the LED.
    #DEFINE LED0 portb.5
    'Set LED as an output
    Dir LED0 Out

    ''' Most programs run in a loop such as this one
    ' Start here
    Do

        ' Set the LED off
        LED0 = LEDOff
        ' Wait in a timer loop for a while
        Wait 100 ms
        ' Turn LED on
        LED0 = LEDOn
        ' Wait some more time
        Wait 100 ms

        ' Return to the top and do it again
    Loop

    ' The program should never get to this line
    '
    ' End execution and put the device into low power sleep mode.
    End
