'''A demonstration program for GCGB and GCB
'''--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
''' This program will toggle the output port using GCBASIC software PWM option.
''' This should generate a PWM of 5.7Khz with a chip frequency of 32Mhz at 50% duty.
'''
''' Changing the chip frequency and the PWM frequency is proportionally scaled.
