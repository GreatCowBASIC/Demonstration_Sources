'''A demonstration program for GCBASIC
'''---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
''' This demonstration simply turns the LED on and off with a wait of 500 ms.
'''
''' This shows how you can use the logic of NOT to toggle an LED.
'''
''' GCBASIC will read the state of the port controlling the LED,
''' then, it will change the state of the port, using the NOT logic,
''' then, it will automatically update the state of the port with this new state.

; ----- Configuration
#chip  LGT8F328P
#option Explicit
'GCBASIC simplifies the configuration by setting the frequency and the configuration for you.   'Set a constant to refer to the LED.
    #DEFINE LED0 portb.5
    'Set LED as an output
    Dir LED0 Out

    ''' Most programs run in a loop such as this one
    ' Start here
    Do

        ' Toggle LED off
        LED0 = NOT LED0
        ' Wait in a timer loop for a while
        Wait 100 ms

        ' Return to the top and do it again
    Loop

    ' The program should never get to this line
    '
    ' End execution and put the device into low power sleep mode.
    End
