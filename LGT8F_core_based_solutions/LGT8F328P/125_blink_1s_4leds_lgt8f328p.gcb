'''A demonstration program for GCBASIC
'''---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
''' This demonstration simply turns the LED on and off with a wait of 1000 ms.   You can change the wait period, just change the constant.
'''
''' This used the millis() library to setup and expose a function that is the running time of the chip in milliseconds ( ms )
''' Using millis() hides the complexity of setting up the timer.
'''
''' In this demo we connect four LEDs and flash them.
''' Connect the LEDs via suitable resistors using a standard LED connection.
