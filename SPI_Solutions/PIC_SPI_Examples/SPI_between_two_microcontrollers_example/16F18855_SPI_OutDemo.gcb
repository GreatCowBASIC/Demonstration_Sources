'''
'''  This demonstration show the transmission and receipt of SPI data.
'''  The ADC port value from the Master is sent to the Slave, both show the value (send and received) on the serial terminal.
'''
'''  This demonstration has two parts the Master and the Slave.  Use 16F18855_SPI_OutDemo.gcb as the Master and 16F18855_SPI_InDemo.gcb for the Slave
'''
'''
''' What do you need?  This used two Xpress Boards and four connections between the boards.
'''     Connections.  0v on board board
'''                   Master MOSI to Slave MISO
'''                   Master MISO to Slave MOSI
'''                   Master Clock to Slave Clock
'''
''' The Master reads the ADV value and send to Slave via SPI
''' The Slave reads the SPI incoming value and shows on the terminal
'''
'''
''' This program can be improved to use a control select line (CS) to tell the Slave data is coming, and,
''' this program can be improvied to use an Interrupt to detect incoming SPI data.  I will let you experiment.
