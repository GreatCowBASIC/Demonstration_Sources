Install Small BASIC from Microsoft/Web site.

As with all Small Basic extensions, copy the extension LitDev.dll and xml  to the  `lib` sub-folder of the Small Basic installation folder, usually in one of the following locations:

C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Small Basic\lib
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Small Basic\lib

You may require to create the lib folder if it doesn't exist, it should already be there in the current version of Small Basic.

Copy all other files (documentation and samples) elsewhere for reference.  This download is the primary resource to get LitDev extension samples.
