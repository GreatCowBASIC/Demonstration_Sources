I wrote a library to program the TLC5620 quad DAC.
This component has four DAC outputs and must be programmed in serial mode.
To do this, a total of four pins on the micro are used.
For more information on the operation of this DAC I recommend reading its datasheet.

I actually wrote two versions of libraries:

The first uses the "#Define" to define the various pins that will be connected to the DAC.
This library takes up less memory space than the second version.

The second version does not use "#Define" but gives the program the possibility to use and change the pins used.
Obviously this option required some work and takes up a bit more memory.

In the two libraries I have included a test routine.

I hope they can be of use to someone.
