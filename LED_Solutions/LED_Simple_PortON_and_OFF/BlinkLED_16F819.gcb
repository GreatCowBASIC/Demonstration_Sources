'''A demonstration program for GCBASIC.
'''--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''This program blink two LEDs on PORTB.0 and PORTB.1 using the ON and OFF commands.
'''The LEDS must be attached via appropiate resistors.
