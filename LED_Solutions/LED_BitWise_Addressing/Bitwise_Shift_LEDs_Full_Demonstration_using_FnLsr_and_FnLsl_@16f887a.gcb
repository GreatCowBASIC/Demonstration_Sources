  '''A demonstration program for GCBASIC.
  '''--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  '''This program demostrates use of the FnLsl and FnLsr command set.
  '''A set eigth LEDs are connected to PortC via eigth suitable resistors, 1k resistors should be adequate for a 5v supply voltage.
  '''A switch is pulled high (to the supply voltage) which is then connected to the microchip.
  '''For the LED and Switch connection please see the program below.
  ''':
  '''This demonstration shifts the LED to the left which turns on each LED in sequence, when the switch is pressed the sequence is reversed.
