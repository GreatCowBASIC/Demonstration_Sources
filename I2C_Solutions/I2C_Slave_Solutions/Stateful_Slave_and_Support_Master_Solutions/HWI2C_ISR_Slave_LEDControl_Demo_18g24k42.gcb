'''A demonstration program for GCBASIC.
'''------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
''' Description: this library provides an ISR to implement
''' A stateful I2C hardware slave.
''' This is a GCB implementation of Microchip Application Note AN734 and TB3159
'''
'''
''' This demonstration responds to a write and reads of bytes to I2C address.
''' This example requires two pots and terminal to show the results.
'''
'''
''' According to AN734, there are 5+1 possible I2C states. During ISR, each
''' of this states are detected. This ISR provides a standard skeleton to implement
''' an I2C hardware slaves, while client code must implement several callbacks
''' the ISR is expecting to call while processing states.
'''
''' Callbacks:
''' - HI2C_Process_In_Message ( in HI2CMESSAGESIZE as byte )
'''      called when slave has recieved a complete I2C write packet
'''
''' - HI2C_Process_Out_Message
'''      called when slave is requested to respond to a masters request, the slave needs to send an I2C packet.
'''
'''
''' We have a Pot attached and 4 LEDS. The Master will request the value of the Pot and then,
''' the Master will set 3 LEDs to the proportional value of the Pot - and, the Master will set the LEDS to the same value - these LEDs are attached the Master microcontroller.
'''
''' The demonstration supports two transactions but this can be easily expanded to support 100s of transaction types.
''' Transaction #1.  Master send I2C packet to address, address, value. as follows to set the LEDs:
'''   0x70, 0x23, 0x00 - turn off all the LEDS
'''   0x70, 0x23, 0x01 - turn on one LED
'''   0x70, 0x23, 0x02 - turn on one LED
'''   0x70, 0x23, 0x03 - turn on two LEDs
'''   0x70, 0x23, 0x04..0xff - turn on LEDs
'''
''' Transaction #2.  Master wants to read the value of the ADC
'''   0x70, 0x81, 0x04, 0x71, 0xNN.   Where 0x81 will instruct this slave to read the ADC, where 0x04 equates to ADC4 and then the READ operation will return the single byte value of the Slave ADC to the Master.
'''   any other ADC port will be returned as 0x00.
'''
'''   To add your own slave commands - simply expand these two methids.
'''
'''   You can also redirect any of the standard callbacks like SI2CSlave_State_Error, SI2CSlave_State_1-6
'''   Use a define to call your own specific routine. like #define SI2CSlave_State_Error  MyHI2CSlave_State_Error
