Handling of the application:

Program starts with selection of step-width, selected step is highlighted with block-cursor.
With encoder rotating the step width is selectable.
A push to the encoder button switches over to frequency selection by rotating encoder. Cursor is an underlined cursor at selected step. Selected step width is applied by rotating the encoder.

Any push to encoder button toggles between selecting step width and selecting frequency.

A push to M-button goes to compensate the oscillator deviation.
The correction uses 10MHz output frequency, any step of encoder rotation changes output with steps of 0.343Hz. Steps and applied correction to output frequency are displayed.
A push to the M-button saves the value to eepprom, a push to the encoder button escapes without changing.
