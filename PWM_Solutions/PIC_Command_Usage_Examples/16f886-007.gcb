' Use program uses the GCBASIC CCP2 PWM.
' This program will setup the specified CCP2/PWM Channel using the in-build GCBASIC PWM calculations
' The registers and bits used can setup any CCP/PWM module.  This assumes that yoor desired PWM frequency is higher than the microcontrollers frequency.
' You will need to add the Postscaler register code to enable lower frequencies. Currently, commented out.
'
' This example uses CCP2 with timer 2 - you have to use timer2 - you cannot change.
