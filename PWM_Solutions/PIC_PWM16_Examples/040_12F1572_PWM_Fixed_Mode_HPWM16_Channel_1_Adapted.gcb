' This program will enable fix mode PWM signals
'
' All the 12 PWM16 channels can configured at seperate fixed frequencies and fixed duty, the syntax is:
'
' #define HPWM16_xx_Freq 38     'Set frequency in KHz on channel xx
' #define HPWM16_xx_Duty 50     'Set duty cycle to 50%  on channel xx
'
' xx can be 1 through 12
'
' To set the parameters of GCBASIC PWM fixed mode on channel 1 use the following:
'
'    #define HPWM16_1_Freq 0.1 to > 1000         'Set the frequency, but, the clock speed must be low for low PWM frequency
'    #define HPWM16_1_Duty 0.1 to 100            'Set duty cycle as percentage 0-100%, just change the number
'
