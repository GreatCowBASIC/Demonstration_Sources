'''A program  for GCGB and GCB.
'''--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''This program demonstrates the PCA9685. The PCA9685 is an I2C-bus controlled 16-channel LED controller optimized for
'''Red/Green/Blue/Amber (RGBA) color backlighting applications.
'''Each LED output has its own 12-bit resolution (4096 steps) fixed frequency individual PWM controller that operates
'''at a programmable frequency from a typical of 24 Hz to 1526 Hz with a duty cycle that is
'''adjustable from 0 % to 100 % to allow the LED to be set to a specific brightness value.
'''
'''All outputs are set to the same PWM frequency.  The demonstration uses hardware I2C.
'''
'''You must call PCA9685_Initialise to initialise the device.
'''The demonstration sets all channels to a value between 0% and 100% dependent on the value of the ADC
'''The program automatically detects the range of the ADC to ensure full operation of the Duty
'''
'''Uses public methods:
''' PCA9685_Initialise
''' PCA9685_SetChannelDuty(  channel as byte , duty as word )  where duty is 0 to 100%
''' PCA9685_SetFreqency ( frequency_wordvalue ) a value from 24 to 1526
'''
'''The library support up to four PCA9685 devices.  They are enables and controlled via the constants shown below.
'''     You can specify your own addresses for the hex value.  The constant name is the critical component.
'''     #define PCA9685_ADDRESS_1 0x80
'''     #define PCA9685_ADDRESS_2 0x82
'''     #define PCA9685_ADDRESS_3 0x84
'''     #define PCA9685_ADDRESS_4 0x86
'''
'''There are many Arduino guides for this board. These guides DO NOT always discuss the READ address for a specific device.
'''The advice for a device board is:
'''For one board:
'''     Solder links is first extra board solder A0.
'''For two boards:
'''     First board do not solder any links
'''     Second board solder A0.
'''     then, connect both boards and use i2c Discover to find addresses of both boards and use those values.
'''     or you will be on a fools errand.
