'''An example program for GCGB and GCB.
'''------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''This program blinks the onboard LED of a microcontroller - simple - the demonstration should work across many microcontrollers.
'''
'''This sample file can be adapted to any of the supported microcontrollers by simply changing the #chip definition - do this by changing to your chip. Other common chips are shown.
'''
'''To make your programmer or your bootloader work, simply do the following.
'''
'''From within this IDE, press function_key F4, then select  'Edit Programmer Preferences'.   This will show you the 'Programmer Preferences', select the 'Programmer' tab.
'''
'''For PIC:  Typically, if you are using a PICKIT2 then select 'Microchip PICKit 2 CLI - Default' will work for you - select and drag this to the top of the dialog area.
'''
'''For AVR:  Typically, for an UNO the programmer 'Arduino UNO/328p@115200' will work, select the option from the list of programmers, then, select 'Edit', 
'''   please edit the communication 'Port', select 'OK', and, then select this option again and drag this to the top of the dialog area.
'''
'''
'''For further adventures with GCBASIC .... Select F4 and then "view Demos" for 1000's of sample programs.
'''
'''
'''Enjoy.
