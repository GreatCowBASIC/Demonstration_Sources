''' GCBASIC demonstration
'''
''' This demonstration simply turns the LED on using the status of the switch AND sends the status to the USB CDC serial port!
'''
'''
''' Attach an LED to the MPLAB� Xpress PIC16F15376 board that can be turned ON via a suitable resistor.
''' and OFF. The LED can be activated by driving the connected I/O line.
'''
''' Atttach a mechanical button with a 10k pull resistor. This is a generic user configurable
''' button and when a button is pressed it will drive the I/O line to GND.
''' If there is no pull-up resistor connected to the generic user button. So we enable
''' the internal pull-up in the PIC16F15376 to use the mechanical button.
