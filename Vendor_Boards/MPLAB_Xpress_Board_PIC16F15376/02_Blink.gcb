''' GCBASIC demonstration
'''
''' This demonstration simply turns the LED on and off with a wait of 500 ms.
'''
''' Attach an LED to the MPLABï¿½ Xpress PIC16F15376 board that can be turned ON via a suitable resistor.
''' and OFF. The LED can be activated by driving the connected I/O line.

'Great Cow BASIC simplifies the configuration by setting the frequency and the configuration for you.

'This option ensures that all variables are dimensioned in the user program.  See http://gcbasic.sourceforge.net/help/__option_explicit.html
#OPTION Explicit



'Set a constant.  The LED can be de-activated by driving the connected I/O line to the supply voltage via a suitable resistor.
#DEFINE LEDOn  = 1
'Set a constant.  The LED can be activated by driving the connected I/O line to GND.
#DEFINE LEDOff = 0

'Set a constant to refer to the LED. Attach via a suitable resistor.

''' Most programs run in a loop such as this one
' Start here
Do

    ' Set the LED off
    LED0 = LEDOff
    ' Wait in a timer loop for a while
    Wait 500 ms
    ' Turn LED on
    LED0 = LEDOn
    ' Wait some more time
    Wait 500 ms

    ' Return to the top and do it again
Loop

' The program should never get to this line
'
' End execution and put the device into low power sleep mode.
