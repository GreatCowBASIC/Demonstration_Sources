''' GCBASIC demonstration
'''
''' This demonstration simply turns the LED on and off using the PWM/CCP module within the microcontroller.  See http://gcbasic.sourceforge.net/help/_hpwm_10_bit.html
''' There are two PWM/CCP channels called CCP1, CCP2, CCP3,  and CCP4. We use CCP1 for this demonstration.  These PWM/CCP channels are 8-bit channels, so, we need to use a value between 0 and 255 to represent 0 to 100 duty.
''' When using GCBASIC you use the PPSTool to set the output port for the CCP1.  We have chosen the LED0 port.
''' When using PWM/CCP you are required to use Timer2, this is mandated, is you wanted to use Timer2 in your user program then you would use the PWM module which enables you to select a wider range of timers.
'''
'''
''' Attach an LED to the MPLABÂ® Xpress PIC16F15376 board that can be turned ON via a suitable resistor.
''' and OFF. The LED can be activated by driving the connected I/O line.
