''' This demonstration simply turns the LED on using a pulse - this is useful for motors also.  See http://gcbasic.sourceforge.net/help/_pulseout.html

''' Attach an LED to the MPLABÂ® Xpress PIC16F15376 board that can be turned ON via a suitable resistor.
''' and OFF. The LED can be activated by driving the connected I/O line.

'Specify the Device you are compiling for - this board is the 16F15376
#CHIP 16F15376
'GCBASIC simplifies the configuration by setting the frequency and the configuration for you.

'This option ensures that all variables are dimensioned in the user program.  See http://gcbasic.sourceforge.net/help/__option_explicit.html
#OPTION Explicit

'Set a constant.  The LED can be de-activated by driving the connected I/O line to the supply voltage via a suitable resistor.
#DEFINE LEDOn  = 1
'Set a constant.  The LED can be activated by driving the connected I/O line to GND.
#DEFINE LEDOff = 0

'Set a constant to refer to the LED. Attach via a suitable resistor.
#DEFINE LED0 portc.1

'Set LED as an output
Dir LED0 Out

''' Most programs run in a loop such as this one
' Start here
Do

    'Turn LED on for 500 ms
    PulseOut LED0, 500 ms
    'Wait with LED off
    Wait 500 ms

    ' Return to the top and do it again
Loop

' The program should never get to this line
'
' End execution and put the device into low power sleep mode.
