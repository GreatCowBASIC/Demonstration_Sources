''' GCBASIC demonstration
'''
''' This demonstration simply turns the LED on. Equates to HelloWorld but this time uses CLC.  There is NO code to make the LED operate.
''' CLC operates within the part. CLC is a programmable combination of gates and latches that can be combined to produce an output.
''' Rather than being a general purpose logic block which can be connected to anything and configured to do anything, there is quite a rigid combination of possible connections.
''' But, we are connecting the Switch to the LED via gates and latches.
'''
''' Attach an LED to the MPLABï¿½ Xpress PIC16F15376 board that can be turned ON via a suitable resistor.
''' and OFF. The LED can be activated by driving the connected I/O line.
'''
'''
''' Atttach a mechanical button with a 10k pull resistor. This is a generic user configurable
''' button and when a button is pressed it will drive the I/O line to GND.
''' If there is no pull-up resistor connected to the generic user button. So we enable
''' the internal pull-up in the PIC16F15376 to use the mechanical button.
