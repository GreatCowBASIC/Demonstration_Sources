''' GCBASIC demonstration
'''
''' This demonstration simply turns the LED on. Equates to HelloWorld.
'''
''' Attach an LED to the MPLABÂ® Xpress PIC16F15376 board that can be turned ON via a suitable resistor.
''' and OFF. The LED can be activated by driving the connected I/O line.

'Set a constant.  The LED can be de-activated by driving the connected I/O line to the supply voltage via a suitable resistor.
#DEFINE LEDOn  = 1
'Set a constant.  The LED can be activated by driving the connected I/O line to GND.
