''' GCBASIC demonstration
'''
''' This demonstration simply turns the LED on using the status of the switch AND sends the status to the USB CDC serial port!
'''
''' There is one yellow LED available on the MPLAB® Xpress PIC16F18446 board that can be turned ON
''' and OFF. The LED can be activated by driving the connected I/O line to GND.
'''
''' MPLAB® Xpress PIC16F18446 contains one mechanical button. This is a generic user configurable
''' button and when a button is pressed it will drive the I/O line to GND.
''' There is no pull-up resistor connected to the generic user button. So we enable
''' the internal pull-up in the PIC16F18446 to use the mechanical button.
