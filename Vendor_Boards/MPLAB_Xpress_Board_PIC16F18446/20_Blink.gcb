''' GCBASIC demonstration
'''
''' This demonstration simply turns the LED on and off with a wait of 500 ms.
'''
''' There is one yellow LED available on the MPLABï¿½ Xpress PIC16F18446 board that can be turned ON
''' and OFF. The LED can be activated by driving the connected I/O line to GND.

''' Most programs run in a loop such as this one
' Start here
Do

    ' Set the LED off
    LED0 = LEDOff
    ' Wait in a timer loop for a while
    Wait 500 ms
    ' Turn LED on
    LED0 = LEDOn
    ' Wait some more time
    Wait 500 ms

    ' Return to the top and do it again
Loop

' The program should never get to this line
'
' End execution and put the device into low power sleep mode.
