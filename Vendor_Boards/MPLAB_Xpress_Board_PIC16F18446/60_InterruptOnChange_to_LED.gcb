''' GCBASIC demonstration
'''
''' This demonstration simply turns the LED on using the status of the switch using an Interrupt.  See http://gcbasic.sourceforge.net/help/_on_interrupt_the_default_handler.html
''' There is no main program... the Interrupt does all the clever work.
'''
''' There is one yellow LED available on the MPLAB® Xpress PIC16F18446 board that can be turned ON
''' and OFF. The LED can be activated by driving the connected I/O line to GND.
'''
''' MPLAB® Xpress PIC16F18446 contains one mechanical button. This is a generic user configurable
''' button and when a button is pressed it will drive the I/O line to GND.
''' There is no pull-up resistor connected to the generic user button. So we enable
''' the internal pull-up in the PIC16F18446 to use the mechanical button.
