''' GCBASIC demonstration
'''
''' This demonstration simply turns the LED on and off using the PWM module within the microcontroller.  See http://gcbasic.sourceforge.net/help/_hpwm_10_bit.html
''' There are two PWM channel called PMW6 and PWM7. We use PWM6 for this demonstration.  These PWM channels are 10-bit channels, so, we need to use a value between 0 and 1023.
''' When using GCBASIC you use the PPSTool to set the output port for the PWM6.  We have chosen the LED0 port.
'''
''' There is one yellow LED available on the MPLABÂ® Xpress PIC16F18446 board that can be turned ON
''' and OFF. The LED can be activated by driving the connected I/O line to GND.
