''' GCBASIC demonstration
'''
''' This demonstration simply turns the LED on using a pulse - this is useful for motors also.  See http://gcbasic.sourceforge.net/help/_pulseout.html
'''
''' There is one yellow LED available on the MPLABÂ® Xpress PIC16F18446 board that can be turned ON
''' and OFF. The LED can be activated by driving the connected I/O line to GND.

''' Most programs run in a loop such as this one
' Start here
Do

    'Turn LED on for 500 ms
    PulseOut LED0, 500 ms
    'Wait with LED off
    Wait 500 ms
