'    There are two pushbuttons: Mode and Set these equate to Key1 and Key2

'    During normal operation, the Mode button will toggle
'    between 12- and 24-hours modes.

'    This has two modes US date and UK date style.
'    Change 'clocktype' to 0 for US and 1 for UK

'    To set a new date and time, press the Set button
'    which will take you consecutively to Month, Day, Year,
'    Day of the Week, Hour, Minute and Second. Within each of
'    these, press Mode to cycle through the possible values.
'    You may hold the Mode button to increment automatically,
'    or press momentarily for a single increment. Time is
'    always set in 24-hour clock format.
'
'    The DS1307 is attached as follows:
'    I2C Data line to RC3
'    I2C Clock line to RC4
'
'    The LCD is attached to the LCD Header
