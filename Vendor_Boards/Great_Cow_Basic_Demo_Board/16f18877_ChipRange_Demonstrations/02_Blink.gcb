''' A demonstration program for GCBASIC.
'''
'''  One way to create a delay is to spend time decrementing a value. In GCBASIC the timing
'''  can be accurately programmed since the user has control on how the
'''  time delays are executed.
'''
'''  This demonstration blinks LED attached to porta.0 at a rate of approximately 1.0 seconds.
'''
''' This demonstration use an LED attached to PORTD.0 via a suitable resistor.
