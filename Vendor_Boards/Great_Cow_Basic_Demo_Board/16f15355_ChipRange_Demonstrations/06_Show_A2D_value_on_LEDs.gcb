''' A demonstration program for GCBASIC.
'''
''' This shows how to read the A2D converter and display the
''' A proportioanal value on the 4 bit LED display.
''' The pot on the board varies the voltage coming in on in A0.
'''
''' The A2D is referenced to the same Vdd as the device, which
''' is nominally is 5V.  The A2D returns the ratio of the voltage
''' on Pin RA0 to 5V.  The A2D has a resolution of 10 bits, with 1023
''' representing 5V and 0 representing 0V.
'''
'''
''' The four LSbs of the ADC are mirrored onto the LEDs.
''' Rotate the potentiometer to change the LEDs displayed.
'''
'''   You need four LEDs connnect to PORTC.0, PORTC.1, PORTC.2 and PORTC.3 connected via suitable resistors.
'''  You will to connect a pot to porta.0.  The needs to be connected the supply voltage and 0v using an appropiate method.
