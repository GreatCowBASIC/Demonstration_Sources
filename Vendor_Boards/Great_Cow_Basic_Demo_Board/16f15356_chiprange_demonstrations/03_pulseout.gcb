''' GCBASIC demonstration

''' This demonstration simply turns the LED on using a pulse - this is useful for motors also.  See http://gcbasic.sourceforge.net/help/_pulseout.html
'''
''' Attach an LED to the MPLABÂ® Xpress PIC16F15356 board that can be turned ON via a suitable resistor.
''' and OFF. The LED can be activated by driving the connected I/O line.
