''' GCBASIC demonstration
'''
''' This demonstration simply turns the LED on and off with a wait of 500 ms.
'''
''' Attach an LED to the MPLABÂ® Xpress PIC16F15356 board that can be turned ON via a suitable resistor.
''' and OFF. The LED can be activated by driving the connected I/O line.

    ''' Most programs run in a loop such as this one
    Do                 ' Start here

      LED0 = LEDOff    ' Set the LED off
      wait 500 ms      ' Wait in a timer loop for a while
      LED0 = LEDOn     ' Turn LED on
      Wait 500 ms      ' Wait some more time

    Loop              ' Return to the top and do it again

    ' The program should never get to this line

    End     ' End execution and put the device into low power sleep mode.
