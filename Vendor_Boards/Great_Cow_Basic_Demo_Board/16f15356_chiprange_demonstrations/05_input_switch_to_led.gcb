''' GCBASIC demonstration
'''
''' This demonstration simply turns the LED on using the status of the switch.
'''
''' Attach an LED to the MPLABÂ® Xpress PIC16F15356 board that can be turned ON via a suitable resistor.
''' and OFF. The LED can be activated by driving the connected I/O line.
'''
''' Atttach a mechanical button with a 10k pull resistor. This is a generic user configurable
''' button and when a button is pressed it will drive the I/O line to GND.
''' If there is no pull-up resistor connected to the generic user button. So we enable
''' the internal pull-up in the PIC16F15356 to use the mechanical button.
