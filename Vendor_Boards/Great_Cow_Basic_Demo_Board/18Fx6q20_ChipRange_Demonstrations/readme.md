# Great-Cow-BASIC

This GIT contains the latest demonstrations.

The baseline set of demonstrations was created at version 2024.x.x of the GCBASIC distribution.

Enjoy


# Layout of Demo programs

This is the standard program. This is included in every GCBASIC installation.  See IDE/Snippets.

# Support for Peripheral Programming Support (PPS)

The PPS method needs to go at the top of the program.

The PPS method must show the version of the PPSTool used to generate the method.

Porting to another microcontroller is easier as the user can locate the PPS method and modify or remove.


# Prototype Board used

We used the a demo board - essentially the chip, some LEDS and resistors.



See Figure A.1 in the [PICKIT2 Low Pin Count Demo Board Userâ€™s Guide](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Low%20Pin%20Count%20User%20Guide%2051556a.pdf) for the example layout.
