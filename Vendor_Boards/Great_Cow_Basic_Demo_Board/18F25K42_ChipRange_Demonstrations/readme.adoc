*The I2C Challenge for the new I2C Module for GCBASIC*


This document discusses implementing 'legacy mode methods using the new I2C module such as the 18F25K42 microcontroller called 'K mode' [after the K42] in this document.

In 'legacy mode' things were rather simple, we simply used the following via to send and recieve data from I2C devices.

----
    I2CStart 'Start of i2c packet

    I2CSend ( 0x78 ) 'slave address

    I2CSend ( 0x51 ) 'send register address

    I2CSend ( 0x52 ) 'send data

    I2CSend ( 0x53 ) 'send more data

    I2CReStart 'ReStart of i2c packet

    I2CReceive ( inbyte1  , ACK )

    I2CReceive ( inbyte2, NACK )

    I2CStop 'End of i2c packet
----

The 'K mode' I2C module implementation does not have reference code for the method of implementation shown above.

The big difference between 'legacy mode' and 'K mode' is not being able to use native use the 'legacy mode' because MicroChip assumed 'K Mode' methods of i2c1_write1ByteRegister,
i2c1_writeNBytes or i2c1_write2ByteRegister where good enough to handle all use case.   Compate these methods the 'legacy mode' methods
of start(), send(address), send(data), send(data_of_unknownlength) and stop().

For GCBASIC a reference implementation is required to support 'legacy mode'.

Background
----------

Great Cow BASIC requires methods to be used to support 'legacy
mode' for I2C because we have have created programs and libraries to communicate with
I2C devices such as I2C Memory, I2C clocks, I2C GLCD displays etc. when using the 'K mode' microcontrollers.

This document has three sections. A review of the 'legacy mode', a
review of the implementation of 'K mode' and a current status of
solutioning on a real 18F25K42.

This document initially focuses on Master Mode/Sending Data. Master
Mode/Receiving Data will be address in a later revision of the document.

A review of Master Mode in 'legacy mode'
-----------------------------------------

Master I2C 'Legacy mode' mode is enabled by setting and clearing the
appropriate SSPM bits in SSPCON and by setting the SSPEN bit. In Master
mode, the SCL and SDA lines are manipulated by the MSSP hardware. Master
mode of operation is supported by interrupt generation on the detection
of the Start and Stop conditions. The Stop (P) and Start (S) bits are
cleared from a Reset or when the MSSP module is disabled. Control of the
I2C bus may be taken when the P bit is set or the bus is Idle, with both
the S and P bits clear. In Firmware Controlled Master mode, user code
conducts all I2C bus operations based on *Start* and *Stop* bit
conditions. Once Master mode is enabled, and the ports etc,, the user has
six operations.

1.  Set the ports up
2.  Assert a Start condition on SDA and SCL.
3.  Assert a Repeated Start condition on SDA and SCL.
4.  Write to the SSPBUF register, initiating transmission of
data/address.
5.  Configure the I2C port to receive data.
6.  Generate an Acknowledge condition at the end of a received byte of
data.
7.  Generate a Stop condition on SDA and SCL.

A baud rate used for the I2C 'legacy mode' operation and this baud rate
is used to set the SCL clock frequency for either 100 kHz, 400 kHz or 1
MHz I2C operation.

[[implementation-of-legacy-mode]]
Implementation of 'Legacy Mode'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Implementing the 'legacy mode' was relatively simple. An eight step
operation (not show all the error handling required!).

1.  Set the ports up
2.  Call a method called *I2CStart()*. This is sets SEN
3.  If required, assert a Repeated Start condition on SDA and SCL by
calling a method called *I2CReStart()*. This is sets RSEN
4.  Call a method called *I2CSend( outbyte)*, this write the output data
to the to the SSPBUF register, which will initiating transmission of
data/address.
5.  Call *I2CReceive( outbyte, ACK | NACK )* to receive data to the
SSPBUF register.
6.  Within the *I2CReceive* method, generate an Acknowledge condition at
the end of a received byte of data, setting ACKDT to 0|1 and set ACKEN.
7.  Call *I2CStop()* to generate a Stop condition on SDA and SCL by
setting PEN.

[[usage-of-legacy-mode]]
Usage of 'legacy mode'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_Baud Rate_

The calculation of Baud Rate is relatively simple.

I2C_BAUD_TEMP = int((ChipMhz * 1000000)/(4000 * DESIRED_I2C_BAUD_RATE))-1

The assignment of the Baud Rate is also simple, using the constant
I2C_BAUD_TEMP

SSPADD = I2C_BAUD_TEMP And 127

_Methods_

The Start(), ReStart() and Stop() are essentially to control the lines.
I2CSend has one parameter, the I2C protocol determines the first byte to
be an address after a Start() or ReStart), then data is either sent or
received.

It is important to note the 'legacy mode' methods do not need to know the size of the
data to be sent or the I2C slave register to set or read. This device
specific library handles the specifics of the I2C device.

A review of Master Mode in 'K mode' that interoperates with 'Legacy mode'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'K mode' Master mode is enabled by setting and clearing the appropriate
bits I2C1CON0.

In Master mode, the SCL and SDA lines are manipulated by the I2C hardware not the software.

Master mode of operation is supported by interrupt generation on the
detection of the Start and Stop conditions.

1.  Set the ports up
2.  Assert a Start condition on SDA and SCL.
3.  Assert a Repeated Start condition on SDA and SCL.
4.  Write data to the output register, initiating transmission of
data/address.
5.  Configure the I2C port to receive data.
6.  Generate an Acknowledge condition at the end of a received byte of
data.
7.  Generate a Stop condition on SDA and SCL.

A register is used for I2C baud rate control in 'K mode' operation. The
baud rate is used to set the SCL clock.

[[implementation-of-k-mode-mode-that-interoperates-with-legacy-mode]]
Implementation of 'K Mode' mode' that interoperates with 'Legacy mode'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Implementing the 'K mode' that interoperates with 'Legacy mode' requires
the user to define a state engine. An eight step process, again this does not show
error handling.

1.  Set the ports up and set StateEngine = 0, see below of registers.
2.  Call a method called *I2CStart()*. This is sets the StateEngine = 0
3.  If required, assert a Repeated Start condition on SDA and SCL by
calling a method called *I2CReStart()*. And, set the StateEngine to 3
4.  Call a method called *I2CSend( outbyte)*, this method handles the
state engine as follows: State handler as follows.

1.  StateEngine = 1: Clear output buffer, set the buffer output count to
0, clear interrupts and load the Address to the Address buffer, wait
while I2C1PIR.SCIF = 0, set I2C1CON0.RSEN=1 and set I2C1CON0.S = 1.
Finally, set state I2C StateEngine = 2
2.  StateEngine = 2. This writes the output data to the to the ouptut
buffer register, which will initiating transmission of data/address by
waiting while I2C1STAT1.TXBE= 0, set I2C1CNT = 1 and load the output
buffer I2C1TXB = I2Coutbyte
3.  StateEngine = 3: Clear output buffer, set the buffer output count to
0, clear interrupts and load the Address to the Address buffer, wait
while I2C1PIR.SCIF = 0, set I2C1CON0.RSEN=1 and set I2C1CON0.S = 1.
Finally, set state I2C StateEngine = 2

1.  Call *I2CReceive( outbyte, ACK | NACK )*
2.  Call *I2CStop()* to generate a Stop condition on SDA and SCL by
waiting for I2C1PIR.PCIF = 1 and waiting for TSCL to complete.

Setting the Ports in 'K Mode'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The I2C module provides a synchronous interface between the
microcontroller and other I2C-compatible devices using the two-wire I2C
serial bus. Devices communicate in a master/slave environment. The I2C
bus specifies two signal connections which are bidirectional open-drain
lines, each requiring pull-up resistors to the supply voltage.

Specific pins are configured for I2C and SMB 3.0/2.0 logic levels. The
SCLx/SDAx signals may be assigned to any of the RB1/RB2/RC3/RC4 pins.
PPS assignments to the other pins (e.g., RA5) will operate, but, input
logic levels will be standard TTL/ST as selected by the INLVL register,
instead of the I2C specific or SMBUS input buffer thresholds.

I/O pins assigned to these signals must be configured as such through
the ANSELx and ODCONx registers, and PPS, respectively. The PPS enables
these pins to function as peripheral inputs (I2CxSCLPPS and I2CxSDAPPS)
and outputs (RxyPPS). Input threshold, slew rate and internal pull-up
settings are configured in the RxyI2C Control registers.

Essentially, setting the ports requires the SCL and SDA pins to be
open-drain, and the these pins *MUST* programmed as *OUTPUTS* by setting
the appropriate TRISC bits which is very different from the 'legacy
mode'.

|3 |0.9a |What is the correct Stop? a|
Is this correct?

Wait until I2C1PIR.PCIF = 1

 a|
The HW will assert a stop automatically when I2CCNT=0; You will then
have to test if the PCIF is set then wait for 2xTSCL to be sure.

So it should be like below

Within Stop method. 1) Why is a delay required? If I DO NOT have a 20us
delay the last byte is not transmitted

\2) Is this delay frequency dependent?

 a|
Like

if I2C1PIR.PCIF = 1 then

*wait 70 us*

exit method

end if

 a|
The delay is required, see page 569 stating that
it requires a TSCL delay.

|5 |0.9a |What is the correct implementation of Restart? a|
Is this correct?

I2C1STAT1.CLRBF = 1 'clear buffer

I2C1CNT = 0 'set to count to 0

I2C1PIR.SCIF = 0 ' clear int

I2C1ADB1 = I2Cbyte 'set the slave address

do while I2C1PIR.SCIF = 0 'wait

I2C1CON0.RSEN = 1 'set ReStart

Loop

|6 |0.9b |When using the initialisation shown in this document for 'K
mode' the first byte transmitted (it will be an address because of the
state engine) does not set the I2C1CON1.ACKSTAT correctly.
|I2C1CON1.ACKSTAT is always 0 for the first byte transmitted, subsequent
bytes are handled correctly. Why? | |Open
