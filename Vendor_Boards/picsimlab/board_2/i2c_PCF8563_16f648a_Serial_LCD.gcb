'''A demonstration program for GCBASIC.
'''--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
''': This program shows the real time clock on a LCD. The LCD is driven by a LCD I2C adapter.
''': Two types of LCD are supported using this method, as shown below:
''':        Set LCD_10 to 10 for the YwRobot LCD1602 IIC V1 or the Sainsmart LCD_PIC I2C adapter
''':        Set LCD_10 to 12 for the Ywmjkdz I2C adapter with pot bent over top of chip
''': The PCF85x3 is attached to the I2C ports with appropiate resistors to the supply voltage.  Typically a 5k or 2.2k resistor 'pulling up' to the supply voltage can be used.
''':
''':    There are two pushbuttons: Mode and Set equates to Key1 and Key2. Connected to portb.0 and portb.1 resepectively.
''':
''':    During normal operation, the Mode button will toggle the Alarm
''':
''':    This has two modes US date and UK date style.
''':    Change ''':clocktype''': to 0 for US and 1 for UK
''':
''':    To set a new date and time, press the Set button
''':    which will take you consecutively to Month, Day, Year,
''':    Day of the Week, Hour, Minute and Second. Within each of
''':    these, press Mode to cycle through the possible values.
''':    You may hold the Mode button to increment automatically,
''':    or press momentarily for a single increment. Time is
''':    always set in 24-hour clock format.
