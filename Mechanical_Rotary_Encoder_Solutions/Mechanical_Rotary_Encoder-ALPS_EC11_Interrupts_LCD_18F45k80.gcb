'''A demonstration program for GCBASIC.
'''--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
''' This program: MEC-ROTARY-EC11-18F45k80.gcb
''' demonstrates the use of mechanical rotary encoder
''' with the ALPS-EC11.h include file.

''' *****************************************
''' Program: Reads a rotary encoder ALPS EC11
'''
''' Turning the knob counts a number up or down in single steps,
''' corresponding to turning sense.
''' Pushing encoder switch, disables counting.
''' Pushing encoder switch again, enables counting again.
''' Encoder works to Vss (0V), ports are pulled up internal.
''' LCD is 2x16 connected as 4 Wire Data (LCD_IO 4).
