'''A demonstration program for GCBASIC.
'''--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''This program demonstrates shows one LCD (16x2 & 16x4) being driven using a LCD I2C adapters.
'''This uses the GCB software implementation of TWI/IC2 for AVR devices.
'''Two types are supported as shown below.  This example is using "#define LCD_IO 10"
'''- Set LCD_I0 to 10 for the YwRobot LCD1602 IIC V1 or the Sainsmart LCD_PIC I2C adapter.
'''- Set LCD_I0 to 12 for the Ywmjkdz I2C adapter with pot bent over top of chip.
'''- Use the following to address a diferent I2C device.
'''-     #define LCD_I2C_Address 0x4e            'This is the default value, change as appropiate
