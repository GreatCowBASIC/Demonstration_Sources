'''A demonstration program for GCBASIC.
'''--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''This program shows the real time clock on an I2C LCD display.  You can change the I2C address.
''':
''':    There are two pushbuttons: Mode and Set equates to Set and the Mode button.  Set the setBut and modeBut port assignment in the program below.
''':
''':    The RTCC 1/2 second clock signal can be
''':    brought out to a pin via PPS called RCC. See
''':    Section 15.0 Peripheral Pin Select
''':    (PPS) Module and Table 15-3 in the datasheet
''':
''':    Clock support battery is connected to Pin 7 (porta.5).  No port assignment is required to support standby batter operation.
''':
''':    This has two modes US date and UK date style.
''':    Change 'clocktype' to 0 for US and 1 for UK
''':
''':    To set a new date and time, press the Set button
''':    which will take you consecutively to Month, Day, Year,
''':    Day of the Week, Hour, Minute and Second. Within each of
''':    these, press Mode to cycle through the possible values.
''':    You may hold the Mode button to increment automatically,
''':    or press momentarily for a single increment. Time is
''':    always set in 24-hour clock format.
''':
''':    This program shows the serial in the PPS subroutine. This is not actually used in this demonstration.
