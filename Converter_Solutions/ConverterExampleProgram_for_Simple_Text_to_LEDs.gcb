'''A demonstration program for GCBASIC.
'''--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'''This program shows the converter capabilities of GCBASIC by converting an external source file to a GCB table.
'''The external source file contains the port settings, as a bit pattern, and the associated delay timings.
'''A set of 8 LEDs would be connected to PortB via appropriate resistors.
'''This program requires the AWK.exe utility, AWKRUN.BAT and the assoicated configuration file (TXT2GCB.INI) to be installed in the GCBasic converters folder.

; ----- Configuration

 #chip 16f877a, 16
 #option explicit

 ; This is the source data file that will be converted into a GCB table by the external converter program.
 #include <..\converters\infraredpatterns.txt>

; ----- Constants
  ' No Constants specified in this example.

; ----- Define Hardware settings
  dir portb out


; ----- Variables
  ' These variables must be WORDs as this could be large table created by the conversion program
  dim TableReadPosition, TableLen as word
  Dim TRANSMISSIONPATTERN, PULSEDELAY as Byte

; ----- Quick Command Reference:
  'This is demonstration of the capabiliites of the GCB converter process.

  'Read the table length from the first entry in the table.
  TableReadPosition = 0

  'Read the rest of the table and use the dataset to to set the LEDs with an appropiate time delay.  These values are obtained from the source file.
