This is a text based game that has elements from a multiple genres dungeon crawl, puzzle, logic challenge, and even resource management. The back story is about a bad Sorcerer who has stolen a magic chalice and you play the plucky adventurer who has to get it back.

The Sorcerer is hiding in the ancient burial grounds, or barrows.

The game is based on a map of the barrows in which there are 42 chambers.

You are dropped randomly into a chamber. In other chamber are gnomes, trolls, dragons etc and in one chamber is the Sorcerer.

The game is played by moving from chamber to chamber exploring. You may view connecting chamber.

You may raise a magic wall in chamber. However you have only 500 magic coins and viewing or raising a wall costs coins so it is important to find the Sorcerer before coins run out.

Enjoy.
