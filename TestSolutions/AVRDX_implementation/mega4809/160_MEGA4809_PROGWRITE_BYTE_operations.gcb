    This program writes a BYTE to PROGRAM memory. 
    The source BYTE is shown below, the result is shown on a serial terminal via the USART.

    Details of writing data into program memory on AVR microcontrollers using GCBASIC.

    Writing Data to Program Memory in AVR Microcontrollers

    1. **Background:**
    - When working with AVR microcontrollers, understanding the fuses and their impact on writing to program memory is crucial.
    - The AVRDX (ATmegaDX) series differs from ATmega328P-type chips in terms of memory organization.

    2. **BOOT Section and APPDATA Section:**
    - The BOOT section resides in low FLASH memory locations. In contrast, ATmega328P-type chips typically place the bootloader close to the end of high FLASH memory.
    - GCBASIC loads the user program into low memory starting at location 0x00.
    - The top of the bootloader (or, in the case of GCBASIC, that is the top of the user program) is referred to as BOOTEND.

    3. **Fuses Configuration:**
    - The BOOTEND and APPEND fuses play a critical role:
        - **BOOTEND**: Determines the end address of the BOOT section.
        - **APPEND**: Sets the starting address of the APPDATA section.
    - The following relationship holds: APPDATA starts at APPEND + 1.

    4. **Calculating APPDATA Start Address:**
    - Let's break down the calculation:
        - If the APPEND fuse is set to 1:
        - APPEND = 1 * 256 = 256
        - APPDATA starts at address 256.
        - If the APPEND fuse is set to 2:
        - APPEND = 2 * 256 = 512
        - APPDATA starts at address 512.
        - If the APPEND fuse is set to 4:
        - APPEND = 4 * 256 = 1024
        - APPDATA starts at address 1024.

    5. **Example:**
    - Suppose BOOTEND is set to 4, and APPEND is also set to 4.
    - The memory layout:
        - 0 to 1023: BOOT section
        - 1024 to 49151: APPDATA section

    Remember that the fuses must be configured appropriately to support the write operation. If the self-write capability of the AVRDX is used, it cannot write to memory locations designated as the bootloader (i.e., within the BOOT section).
